## Synopsis

This playbook is for a raspi/tiny AM transmitter setup I run to transmit JJY atomic time broadcast locally for my Citizen AT6080-53l watch.
It's a Japanese Domestic Market I imported, which attempts to sync to the Japanese station(s) JJY that braodcast current atomic time.

This runs briefly on cron at night when it tries to sync and broadcasts just enough to allow the watch to sync up time nightly if its on my bedside table.
