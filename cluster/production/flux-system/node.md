# Flux system componends.

Core flux components - yaml generated by flux during bootstrap.


## Manual update Flux

This should not be needed since there is GitHub workflow to do this automatically via PR (.github/workflow/flux.yaml)

1. Update staging
   ```
   flux install --export>clusters/staging/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml
   ```
2. Update production
   ```
   flux install --export>clusters/production/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml
   ```
